# Challenger deep theme for Blinksh

This is a theme for [blinksh](http://blink.sh/) based on the [Challenger deep](https://challenger-deep-theme.github.io/) color schemes.

## Installation
As Blink Shell is a web terminal, themes and fonts are applied over the web and downloaded to your device for faster loading. We recommend GitHub as the fastest way to do that, but any file server will do.

Create a Gist and get the "raw" URL for it.
Go to Settings -> Appeareance -> (New Font || New Theme) -> Paste the URL and download it -> Save and select it from the list.
